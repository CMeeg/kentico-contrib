# Meeg.Kentico.ContentComponents.Cms.Admin

Thanks for installing the Content Components module!

## Getting started

After installing this package there are a few things you will need to do before you can get started:

* Build this solution
* Finish the installation or update by opening your CMS application in a browser
	* This will trigger the application to automatically import database objects from the module installation package to the Kentico database
* Verify that the module was installed or updated successfully in the Event log - check that the log contains no errors and one of the following events exists
	* If you are installing this module for the first time: Source = ModuleInstaller, Event code = MODULEINSTALLED
	* If you are updating this module: Source = ModuleInstaller, Event code = MODULEUPDATED

Now you can use the Content Components module!

Please read through the [documentation](https://github.com/CMeeg/kentico-contrib/tree/master/src/Meeg.Kentico.ContentComponents) if this is the first time you have used the module.
